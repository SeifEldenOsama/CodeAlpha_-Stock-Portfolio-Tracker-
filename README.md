Description
As part of my internship at CodeAlpha, I developed a simple Stock Portfolio Tracker. This project allows users to input stock names and quantities, calculates the total investment based on predefined stock prices, and provides an option to save the results in a text or CSV file.

Key Features:
User Inputs: Users can enter various stock names and the corresponding quantities they wish to track.
Hardcoded Stock Prices: The application utilizes a dictionary to define stock prices for easy reference.
Investment Calculation: The total investment value is calculated automatically based on user inputs.
File Saving Option: Users can choose to save their portfolio details to a file for future reference.
This project showcases my ability to apply basic programming concepts such as dictionaries, input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and file handling in Python. It serves as a foundational tool for anyone interested in tracking their stock investments effectively.
